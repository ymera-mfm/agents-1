## 🔌 Backend Integration

The frontend is designed to integrate with a backend API. See the [Backend Integration Guide](frontend/BACKEND_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md) for:

- Complete API endpoint specifications (50+ endpoints)
- WebSocket event definitions (15+ events)
- Authentication flow (JWT-based)
- Data models and schemas
- Error handling standards
- Deployment configuration

### Quick Backend Setup

1. Configure your backend API URL:
```bash
cd frontend
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set REACT_APP_API_URL and REACT_APP_WS_URL
```

2. Test the connection:
```javascript
import backendIntegration from './utils/backendIntegration';
const result = await backendIntegration.testConnection();
```

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

The frontend includes Docker support for easy deployment:

```bash
cd frontend

# Build Docker image
npm run docker:build

# Run with Docker Compose
npm run docker:compose:up

# Or use docker-compose directly
docker-compose up -d
```

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
cd frontend

# Run unit tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run end-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e
```
