## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in AgentFlow, please send an email to security@agentflow.com.

We take all security vulnerabilities seriously and will respond as quickly as possible.

### What to Include

Please include:
- **Description of the vulnerability:** Clear explanation of the security issue
- **Steps to reproduce:** Detailed steps to demonstrate the vulnerability
- **Potential impact:** Assessment of the security impact
- **Suggested fix (if any):** Proposed remediation steps
- **Your contact information:** For follow-up questions

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment:** Within 48 hours of report
- **Initial Assessment:** Within 7 days
- **Status Updates:** Every 7 days until resolved
- **Resolution:** Based on severity (Critical: 1-3 days, High: 7-14 days, Medium: 30 days)

## üîç Security Scanning

### Automated Security Scans

We have implemented automated security scanning tools:

```bash
# Run comprehensive security scan
npm run security:scan

# Run dependency vulnerability check
npm audit

# Check for outdated packages
npm outdated
```

### Security Scan Features

Our security scanner checks for:

- ‚úÖ Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
- ‚úÖ Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection
- ‚úÖ Insecure data storage
- ‚úÖ HTTPS enforcement
- ‚úÖ Security headers configuration
- ‚úÖ Content Security Policy (CSP)
- ‚úÖ Cookie security
- ‚úÖ Input validation
- ‚úÖ Authentication security
- ‚úÖ Data exposure risks
- ‚úÖ Hardcoded secrets
- ‚úÖ Dependency vulnerabilities
- ‚úÖ Configuration security

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures Implemented

### 1. HTTPS Enforcement

- All production traffic uses HTTPS
- HTTP requests are automatically redirected to HTTPS
- Strict-Transport-Security header enabled

### 2. Security Headers

```nginx
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
Referrer-Policy: no-referrer-when-downgrade
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
```

### 3. Content Security Policy (CSP)

- Restricts resource loading to trusted sources
- Prevents inline script execution in production
- Mitigates XSS attacks

### 4. Authentication & Authorization

- JWT-based authentication
- Secure session management
- Session timeout after inactivity
- Secure cookie attributes (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)

### 5. Input Validation & Sanitization

- All user inputs are validated
- XSS protection through DOMPurify
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- CSRF token validation

### 6. Data Protection

- Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- Secure data transmission over HTTPS
- No sensitive data in localStorage
- Password hashing with bcrypt

### 7. Error Handling

- Generic error messages in production
- Detailed logging server-side only
- No stack traces exposed to users

### 8. Rate Limiting

- API endpoint rate limiting
- Protection against brute force attacks
- DDoS mitigation

### 9. Dependency Management

- Regular dependency updates
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- No known vulnerabilities in production

### 10. Docker Security

- Non-root user in containers
- Minimal base images
- Security scanning of Docker images

## üìã Security Checklist

Before deploying to production, ensure:

- [ ] All dependencies are up to date
- [ ] No critical or high vulnerabilities in npm audit
- [ ] HTTPS is enabled and enforced
- [ ] Security headers are configured
- [ ] CSP is properly set
- [ ] Authentication is working correctly
- [ ] Sensitive data is encrypted
- [ ] Error messages don't expose sensitive information
- [ ] Rate limiting is enabled
- [ ] Logging is properly configured
- [ ] Security scan passes (npm run security:scan)

## üîê Security Best Practices

For developers working on AgentFlow:

1. **Never commit secrets** - Use environment variables
2. **Validate all inputs** - Never trust user input
3. **Use HTTPS everywhere** - No exceptions
4. **Implement least privilege** - Grant minimal required permissions
5. **Keep dependencies updated** - Regular npm updates
6. **Review code for security** - Security-first mindset
7. **Log security events** - Monitor for suspicious activity
8. **Test security regularly** - Automated and manual testing

See [Security Best Practices Guide](docs/SECURITY_BEST_PRACTICES.md) for detailed guidelines.
