**File 1**: `docs/FEATURE_REQUEST_TEMPLATE_GUIDE.md` (10,183 characters)
- Comprehensive guide to using the template
- Section-by-section explanations
- Best practices and examples
- Methodology for system analysis
- Analysis results documentation

**File 2**: `docs/SYSTEM_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md` (11,988 characters)

## Template Effectiveness

### How the Template Helped

The template's structured approach provided:

1. **Systematic Analysis**: Guided thorough examination of codebase
2. **Prioritization Framework**: Helped identify critical vs. minor issues
3. **Documentation Structure**: Provided format for reporting findings
4. **Verification Checklist**: Ensured all changes were validated
5. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Ensured no aspect was overlooked

### Sections Applied

- ✅ Feature Summary (defined analysis scope)
- ✅ Current Behavior (documented system state)
- ✅ Proposed Behavior (defined cleanup goals)
- ✅ Technical Requirements (identified files to modify/remove)
- ✅ Acceptance Criteria (created verification checklist)
- ✅ Test Scenarios (defined validation tests)
- ✅ Security Considerations (verified no vulnerabilities introduced)
- ✅ Performance Requirements (monitored build time)

## Files Changed

### Created ✨
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature-request-enhanced.yml` (template)
- `docs/FEATURE_REQUEST_TEMPLATE_GUIDE.md` (documentation)
- `docs/SYSTEM_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md` (analysis report)
- `docs/FEATURE_REQUEST_TEMPLATE_SUMMARY.md` (this file)

### Modified 🔧
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/README.md` (documentation update)

### Deleted 🗑️
- `src/services/cacheService.js.jsx` (duplicate)
- `src/services/websocketService.js.jsx` (duplicate)

## Recommendations for Future Use

### Using the Enhanced Template

**Best For**:
- Complex features requiring detailed specifications
- Features needing Copilot/AI assistance
- Real-time systems (WebSocket, notifications, etc.)
- Features with strict security/performance requirements
- Multi-phase implementations
- Features requiring comprehensive testing

**Process**:
1. Create new issue using the template
2. Fill in all required sections thoroughly
3. Be specific with examples and measurements
4. Include mockups and visual references
5. Set realistic, measurable acceptance criteria
6. Define clear test scenarios

### System Analysis

The template methodology can be applied for:
- Code quality audits
- Performance optimization planning
- Security vulnerability assessment
- Technical debt evaluation
- Refactoring initiatives
- Dependency upgrade planning
