## Usage Instructions

### For Developers

**Validate Environment Before Deployment:**
```bash
npm run validate:env:prod
```

**Run All Pre-Deployment Checks:**
```bash
npm run predeploy
```

**Deploy to Production:**
```bash
# Option 1: Vercel
npm run deploy:vercel

# Option 2: Docker
npm run deploy:docker

# Option 3: AWS S3
npm run deploy:aws:s3
```

**Verify Deployment:**
```bash
npm run deploy:verify:prod
```

### For DevOps

**Review Checklists:**
1. `docs/PRODUCTION_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md` - Before deployment
2. `docs/PRODUCTION_SECURITY_CONFIG.md` - Configuration reference
3. `docs/OPERATIONS_RUNBOOK.md` - Operational procedures

**Run Validation:**
```bash
# Validate all environments
npm run validate:env:dev
npm run validate:env:staging
npm run validate:env:prod
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Before First Production Deployment)

1. **Configure Production Environment Variables**
   - Update `.env.production` with real API URLs
   - Set up Sentry account and add DSN
   - Set up Analytics and add tracking ID

2. **Obtain SSL Certificates**
   - Choose certificate provider
   - Install certificates
   - Configure nginx with certificate paths

3. **Deploy Backend API**
   - Deploy FastAPI backend
   - Configure database connections
   - Set up Redis cache
   - Verify health endpoints

4. **Set Up Monitoring**
   - Create Sentry project
   - Configure analytics platform
   - Set up uptime monitoring
   - Configure alerting

5. **Execute Deployment Checklist**
   - Follow `PRODUCTION_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md`
   - Complete all pre-deployment checks
   - Execute deployment
   - Verify all systems

### Ongoing Maintenance

1. **Regular Reviews**
   - Security configuration: Quarterly
   - Dependencies: Monthly
   - SSL certificates: 30 days before expiration
   - Secrets rotation: Every 90 days

2. **Monitoring**
   - Check Sentry for errors daily
   - Review performance metrics weekly
   - Analyze logs for security events
   - Monitor uptime and response times

3. **Updates**
