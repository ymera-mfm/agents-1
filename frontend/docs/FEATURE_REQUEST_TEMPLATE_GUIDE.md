# Feature Request Template Guide

## Overview

The **Enhanced Feature Request Template** (`feature-request-enhanced.yml`) is a comprehensive, Copilot-optimized template designed to facilitate detailed feature planning and implementation. This guide explains how to use the template effectively and documents the system analysis performed.

## Template Sections

### 1. Feature Summary
**Purpose**: Provide a clear, concise description of the proposed feature.

**Best Practice**: Keep it to 1-2 sentences that capture the essence of the feature.

**Example**:
```
Add real-time notification system for user activity updates
```

### 2. User Story (üìñ)
**Purpose**: Describe the feature from the user's perspective using the standard user story format.

**Structure**:
- **As a** [user role]
- **I want to** [desired functionality]
- **So that** [business value/benefit]
- **User Flow**: Step-by-step interaction flow

**Why It Matters**: Keeps the implementation focused on user needs rather than technical details.

### 3. Current Behavior (üîÑ)
**Purpose**: Document how the system currently works or what's missing.

**Include**:
- Current limitations
- Pain points
- Missing functionality
- User workarounds

### 4. Proposed Behavior (‚úÖ)
**Purpose**: Define the desired state after implementation.

**Include**:
- New functionality

```

### 6. API Specifications (üîå)
**Purpose**: Define API contracts, data structures, and WebSocket events.

**Include**:
- REST endpoints with HTTP methods
- WebSocket events (client ‚Üí server, server ‚Üí client)
- Data structures (TypeScript interfaces or JSON schemas)
- Request/response examples

**Best Practice**: Use code blocks for clarity and use TypeScript interfaces even if not using TypeScript.

### 7. UI/UX Specifications (üé®)
**Purpose**: Describe the visual and interaction design.

**Include**:
- Component locations and layout
- Sizes and positioning
- Interaction patterns
- Animations and transitions

### 8. Acceptance Criteria (‚úÖ)
**Purpose**: Define when the feature is considered complete.

**Format**: Checklist of specific, measurable, testable criteria.

**Examples**:
```yaml
- [ ] Users receive notifications within 1 second of trigger
- [ ] Notification badge shows accurate unread count
- [ ] System handles 1000+ concurrent WebSocket connections
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (>85%)
```

### 9. Test Scenarios (üß™)
**Purpose**: Define specific test cases to validate the feature.

**Categories**:
- **Functional Tests**: Core feature functionality
- **Integration Tests**: System integration points
- **Performance Tests**: Load and stress testing
- **Edge Cases**: Error handling and boundary conditions

### 10. Dependencies & Prerequisites (üì¶)
**Purpose**: Identify what must exist before implementation.

**Include**:

- Rate limiting
- Secure communication protocols

### 12. Performance Requirements (‚ö°)
**Purpose**: Set quantifiable performance targets.

**Include**:
- Response time targets
- Scalability requirements
- Resource usage limits
- Database optimization needs

### 13. Coding Standards & Patterns (üìù)
**Purpose**: Ensure consistent code quality.

**Include**:
- Architecture patterns to follow
- Code style guidelines
- Testing requirements
- Documentation standards

### 14. Priority
**Purpose**: Help with feature prioritization.

**Options**:
- üî¥ Critical - Core functionality
- üü† High - Important for user experience
- üü° Medium - Nice to have
- üü¢ Low - Future enhancement

### 15. Implementation Phases (üóìÔ∏è)
**Purpose**: Break down complex features into manageable phases.

**Structure**: Week-by-week or phase-by-phase breakdown with specific deliverables.

### 16. Mockups / Examples (üé®)
**Purpose**: Provide visual references.

**Include**:
- Design mockup links (Figma, Sketch, etc.)
- Screenshot URLs
- Reference examples from other applications

### 17. Additional Context (üìö)
**Purpose**: Capture any other relevant information.

**Include**:
- User research data
- Business drivers
- Related discussions
- Competitor analysis

### 18. Pre-implementation Checklist (üéØ)
**Purpose**: Ensure readiness before starting work.

**Checklist Items**:
- [ ] Feature approved by stakeholders
- [ ] Technical design reviewed by team
- [ ] Dependencies identified and ready
- [ ] Acceptance criteria defined
- [ ] Test scenarios documented
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Performance requirements clear
- [ ] Timeline and phases agreed upon

## Using the Template for System Analysis

### Methodology

The template can be used to systematically analyze existing systems by treating analysis as a "feature" to implement improvements. Here's how:

1. **Feature Summary**: "Analyze and optimize [system component]"
2. **Current Behavior**: Document actual system state with measurements
3. **Proposed Behavior**: Define optimization goals
4. **Technical Requirements**: Identify specific improvements needed
5. **Acceptance Criteria**: Set measurable improvement targets

### System Analysis Results (October 24, 2025)

Using this template methodology, we analyzed the ymera-frontend system and identified the following issues:

#### Issue #1: Duplicate Service Files
**Problem**: Found duplicate service implementations with incorrect file extensions:
- `cacheService.js.jsx` (duplicate, unused)
- `websocketService.js.jsx` (duplicate, unused)

**Impact**: 
- Code confusion and maintenance burden
- Incorrect file extensions (.jsx for non-JSX code)
- Potential for using wrong implementation

**Resolution**: 
- ‚úÖ Removed `cacheService.js.jsx`
- ‚úÖ Removed `websocketService.js.jsx`
- ‚úÖ Verified correct implementations in `cache.js` and `websocket.js` are being used
- ‚úÖ Build verification passed

**Files Modified**:
- Deleted: `src/services/cacheService.js.jsx`
- Deleted: `src/services/websocketService.js.jsx`

**Test Results**:
- ‚úÖ Build completes successfully
- ‚úÖ No broken imports detected
- ‚úÖ All existing functionality preserved

#### Analysis Statistics
- **Total Files Analyzed**: 69 source files
- **Critical Issues Found**: 2
- **Issues Resolved**: 2
- **Build Status**: ‚úÖ Passing
- **Lint Status**: ‚úÖ Passing
