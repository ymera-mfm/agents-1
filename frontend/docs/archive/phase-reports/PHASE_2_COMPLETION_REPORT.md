## Next Steps

Phase 2 is complete. Recommended next steps:
1. Run tests in actual environment to validate test scenarios
2. Update test data based on actual backend API responses
3. Add more edge case tests as needed
4. Integrate tests into CI/CD pipeline
5. Set up scheduled test runs for regression testing
6. Monitor test flakiness and adjust timeouts/waits as needed
