- Scalability Goals (with metrics)

### 8. **System Upgrade Opportunities** (Required Dropdown)
Options:
- Yes - Check for all possible upgrades
- Yes - Only security-critical upgrades
- Yes - Only dependency upgrades
- No - Keep current versions

### 9. **Upgrade Specifications** (Optional)
Define constraints and requirements for upgrades when applicable.

### 10. **Integration & Expansion Requirements** (Required)
Ensure system readiness for future integration and expansion:

- Conflict Resolution checklist
- Consolidation Rules

### 12. **Coding Standards & Context** (Required)
Provide coding standards so Copilot matches your style:
- Language Standards
- Naming Conventions
- Testing Standards
- Documentation requirements

### 13. **Acceptance Criteria** (Required)
Define what constitutes successful completion with measurable criteria.

### 14. **Additional Context** (Optional)
Any other information Copilot should know:
- Related issues
- Previous attempts
- Business constraints
- External dependencies

### 15. **Copilot Tools to Use** (Checkboxes)
Select which Copilot features to leverage:
- Code completion
- Copilot Chat
- Code review
- Test generation
- Documentation generation
- Refactoring suggestions
- Performance optimization hints

## üí° Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific
The more details you provide, the better Copilot can help. Include:
- Exact file paths
- Specific line numbers
- Concrete metrics
- Real error messages

### 2. Include Real Examples
Show current vs. expected behavior with actual data:
- ‚ùå "Slow response time"
- ‚úÖ "Response time: 800ms (current) ‚Üí <200ms (target)"

### 3. Break Down Large Tasks
If the analysis is too complex, split into multiple issues:
- Security analysis issue
- Performance optimization issue
- Code quality improvement issue

### 4. Provide Context
Share supporting materials:
- Architecture diagrams
- Coding standards documents
- Related documentation
- Performance reports

### 5. Iterate
Start with simple fixes, then move to optimizations:
1. Fix critical bugs first
2. Address performance issues
3. Refactor and optimize
4. Update documentation

## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Create New Issue**
   - Navigate to repository Issues
   - Click "New Issue"
   - Select "üîç System Analysis & Optimization"

2. **Fill Required Fields**
   - Complete all required sections
   - Be as specific as possible
   - Include real data and metrics

3. **Assign to Copilot**
   - Tag the issue with `copilot-task`
   - Mention @copilot if needed
   - Let Copilot analyze and respond

4. **Review Copilot's Work**
   - Check proposed changes
   - Verify tests pass
   - Validate performance improvements

5. **Iterate if Needed**
   - Provide feedback
   - Request adjustments
   - Refine requirements
