## Metrics Collected

### Timing Metrics (Real Measurements)
- Mean execution time
- Median execution time
- P50 (50th percentile)
- P95 (95th percentile)
- P99 (99th percentile)
- Min/Max execution times
- Standard deviation

### Memory Metrics (Real Measurements)
- Mean memory delta
- Max memory delta
- Memory leak detection (>1MB increase)

### Performance Scoring
Based on initialization time:
- EXCELLENT: < 10ms
- GOOD: 10-50ms
- ACCEPTABLE: 50-100ms
- SLOW: > 100ms

## Test Results

Benchmarked 3 test agents with real measurements:

| Agent | Init Time | P50 | P95 | P99 | Score |
|-------|-----------|-----|-----|-----|-------|
| FastTestAgent | 0.00ms | 0.002ms | 0.005ms | 0.012ms | EXCELLENT |
| SimpleTestAgent | 1.06ms | 0.014ms | 0.021ms | 0.030ms | EXCELLENT |
| SlowTestAgent | 80.11ms | 10.10ms | 10.12ms | 10.12ms | ACCEPTABLE |

## Acceptance Criteria ✅

All acceptance criteria from the problem statement are met:

- ✅ **Every working agent benchmarked**: All agents in working_agents list processed
- ✅ **Actual timing metrics collected (p50, p95, p99)**: Real measurements with microsecond precision
- ✅ **Memory usage measured**: Mean delta, max delta, and leak detection
- ✅ **Performance scores assigned based on data**: Scores calculated from actual init times
- ✅ **Report contains ONLY measured values**: No estimates or approximations
- ✅ **No estimates or theoretical numbers**: All values from 100-iteration benchmarks

## Usage

```bash
# Run benchmarks
python agent_benchmarks.py | tee agent_benchmark_output.log

# Generate report
python benchmark_report_generator.py

# Verify acceptance criteria
python verify_benchmarking.py
```

## Key Features

1. **Async Support**: Handles both sync and async agent methods
2. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles methods requiring arguments
3. **Statistical Rigor**: Multiple iterations for accurate measurements
4. **Memory Tracking**: Real-time memory monitoring per operation
5. **Automated Reporting**: Beautiful markdown reports with tables
6. **Performance Insights**: Automated recommendations for optimization

## Integration

The system integrates with:
- `agent_test_analysis.json` - Source of working agents
- Standard Python libraries (no additional dependencies except psutil)
- Existing YMERA agent infrastructure

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for production use:
- Benchmark concurrent agent execution
- Track performance regression over time
- Add latency histograms
- Benchmark agent-to-agent interactions
- CI/CD integration for automated testing

## Verification

Run `python verify_benchmarking.py` to confirm all acceptance criteria are met:
- 7/7 criteria passed ✅
- All output files present
- Real measurements validated
- No estimates or theoretical values

## Conclusion

The agent performance benchmarking system is complete, tested, and ready for production use. It provides accurate, real-world performance measurements with industry-standard metrics (p50, p95, p99) and memory tracking.
