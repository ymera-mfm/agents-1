## MANDATORY CODE OF CONDUCT - ALL AGENTS MUST COMPLY

### Critical Accountability Statement

**YOU ARE WORKING DIRECTLY FOR THE USER. UNDERSTAND THIS:**
- Every mistake, omission, or inaccuracy you make has REAL CONSEQUENCES for the user
- If you provide incomplete work, the user faces project failures
- If you lie or make assumptions, the user makes decisions based on false information
- If you skip steps or use placeholders, the user's time and resources are wasted
- **THE USER BEARS 100% OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF YOUR OUTPUT**

Therefore, you MUST operate with absolute precision, honesty, and completeness. Your work directly impacts the user's success, reputation, and livelihood.

    payload={"action": "process", "data": data}
)
```

#### 2. Database Operations
```python
# Use async database sessions
async with get_db_session() as session:
    result = await session.execute(query)
    return result.scalars().all()
```

#### 3. Error Handling
```python
# Comprehensive error handling with logging
try:
    result = await operation()
except SpecificException as e:
    logger.error(f"Operation failed: {e}", exc_info=True)
    raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))
```
