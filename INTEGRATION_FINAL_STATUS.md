## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Current Configuration
- ✅ JWT authentication configured
- ✅ Rate limiting enabled
- ✅ CORS properly configured
- ✅ Development/production modes separated
- ⚠️ Default JWT secret (CHANGE IN PRODUCTION)
- ⚠️ Database using default credentials (UPDATE FOR PRODUCTION)

### For Production Deployment
1. **Generate New JWT Secret**
   ```bash
   openssl rand -hex 32
   ```
   Update in `.env` file

2. **Update Database Credentials**
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://prod_user:strong_password@db_host:5432/prod_db
   ```

3. **Configure Redis with Password**
   ```env
   REDIS_URL=redis://:password@redis_host:6379/0
   ```

4. **Set Production Environment**
   ```env
   ENVIRONMENT=production
   DEBUG=False
   ```
